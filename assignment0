1. 
  1. Nike is my favorite website to use because it is aesthetically pleasing when I go shopping on there and the animations flow so well and flawlessly.
  Nike link: https://www.nike.com/
  How it can be improved: It can enlarge the text in some areas because it can be hard to read at times.
  2. The Gazette-times website is a website I do not enjoy using because there is alot going on and it is hard to navigate. It can also be hard to distinguish between ads and actual news articles.

  How it can be improved: Making it easier to distinguish what the ads are and what are news articles. Also displaying less ads would be nice.
  3. My friend who lives in hawaii has a coffee shop there and his website is really nice in my opinion. I like the layout and design especially the wave animation in the background that sets a nice mood and enhances the user experience.

  How it can be improved: There alot of pictures fromm the shop at the bottom of the webpage that can be sorted into a gallery section of the website that the user clicks on.
  4. My favorite food place in town is local boyz hawaiian food but there website can use some work. It is a single page that is basically a flyer that shows the restaurant phone number and a link to click on the menu.

  How it can be improved: By turning it into an actual webiste with more functionality instead of just a flyer. 
  5. Reddit is a website I truly appreciate. It is not too flashy but very easy to navigate and provides the user with a great user experience due to it's ability to display only what is neccessary.
  Reddit link: https://www.reddit.com/
  How it can be improved: Some of the icons in the right corner are hard to decipher because they are not labeled. By adding labels it may make it easier to know what you are clicking on.
